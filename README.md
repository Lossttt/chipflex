# ChipFlex by Berry and Lost

ChipFlex is a terminal application specially designed to generate quotes for companies in the shipbuilding industry. It is automated, meaning it can perform certain tasks and calculations without user intervention.

The application was originally developed as an assignment from The Hague University of Applied Sciences, where it was programmed in Java. However, to gain additional knowledge in C, I decided to re-develop the application in this language with the help of berry.

As a Chip Flex user you can enter various parameters, such as the options of the ship and the required materials. The application can then automatically generate a quotation based on this information. This saves time and makes the quote generation process more efficient and accurate.
